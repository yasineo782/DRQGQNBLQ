### Logo Usage:
- **N Symbol:** Used in high-awareness markets, always appears in signature red.
- **Wordmark:** Essential identifier, used in low-awareness markets or when production limits color.

### Clearspace:
- N Symbol: Clear space is the width of one leg of the N.
- Wordmark: Clear space is the width of the T.

### Readability:
- When placing a logo on a background, aim for a contrast ratio of 2.25:1 or higher.

### Things To Avoid (N Symbol):
- Changing the gradient, stretching, adding effects, placing over busy backgrounds, changing color, rotating, flattening to one color, making ribbons, placing in a shape or container, using on a red background, using the symbol to replace any letterform, substituting the N from the Wordmark for the symbol, flipping the symbol, locking up words with the N-Symbol, placing on the ground or anywhere it can be stepped on, placing on food.

### Things To Avoid (Wordmark):
- Using a white Wordmark (without approval), stretching, adding effects, placing over busy backgrounds, changing color, rotating, flipping, using the Wordmark and the N Symbol in the same layout, writing words in the style of the logo, placing in a shape or container, using in a sentence, using an old version, placing on the ground or anywhere it can be stepped on, placing on food.
